Log of bug fixes, feature and application additions.

2009 1 30
Added IOCStatus mapping, and enhanced idt::ioc to allow for editing.

CVS TAG Point: irmisBase_V2.2

2008 9 8
Added Component History Tool. This is both a browser based interface, as well as
the database schema and services API. Allows tracking data on individual serial-numbered
components in the system. Things like location history, operational state (broken/working),
calibration history, etc. 

CVS TAG Point: irmisBase_V2.1

2006 10 15
Again, I haven't been good about maintaining this change log, but...
Cable application was worked on a fair bit to improve user interaction.
A stricter edit lock was implemented which only allows one edit at a time.
A second user is forced to refresh their GUI before their edit can proceed.
This prevents problems with data integrity that can arise from concurrent
editing, especially when complex data structures like trees are represented.

CVS TAG Point: irmisBase_V2.0

2006 05 25
Completed testing for out-of-the-box Oracle and MySQL install. Releasing
new version 2.0.

2006 05 09
Yikes. I have not been maintaining this. There have been lots and lots of
changes and new work since last entry. Most importantly, I have completed
component and cable applications. Also, I migrated from Hibernate 2.1.8 to
3.1.3.

2005 06 23
Changed DAOContext.java to look inside jar files for needed hibernate DTD's,
rather than hitting public servers at sourceforge.net. In short, you can run
the pv viewer behind a firewall now with no public internet access.

2005 06 20
Fixed behavior of ioc attribute edit table to be more spreadsheet-like
where an "enter" will cancel editing. Ctrl-enter will insert a newline.

CVS TAG Point: irmisBase_V1.2

2005 06 14
Enhanced (some would say fixed) the history mode. Existence of record
across many ioc boots (and possibly more than one ioc) is shown correctly now.

2005 06 07
Added ability to have a login dialog which simply asks for your username.
This is a low-security option for places that want to know who did what,
but are willing to allow the honor system.

2005 05 25
Added ability to customize display columns for pv search results.
Added ability to save tab-separated file with search results.

2005 05 23
Improved process_sprint in pv_crawler per Judy Rock, and fixed minor parsing bug.

2005 05 20
Modified field display to use field order as given by dbd field definition.
Added click-to-sort to several pv viewer table columns.
Added display of number of pv search results.

2005 05 19
Fixed display bugs that came about due to some thread race conditions.
Fixed bug whereby busy cursor not shown consistently during db accesses.

2005 05 18
Shut off most of hibernate logging, except warnings and above.

2005 05 17
Substantially refactored BaseDAO and added IRMISService layer. All application code
now calls the service layer rather than the DAO layer directly. Any domain business
logic is moved into the service layer.

CVS TAG Point: irmisBase_V1.1 

2005 05 12
Added IOC "editor" capability for editing/adding ioc's and ioc
attributes to the db tables.
Added minor tweak per Thomas Birke to allow adl crawler to process
dm2k adl files.
Removed junit test cases. Not maintained, and causing build problems.

2005 05 04
Fixed some problems with the multi-window desktop focus behavior.
Added login status information to title bar of desktop.
Fixed pv viewer so that record type list is populated from database.

2005 05 03
Added pv_crawler parser support for "sprint VAR,"quoted literal""
Fixed pv_crawler parser so it skips indented comments properly.
Added pv_crawler parser support for casts on RHS of var assignments.

2005 04 26
Added Java JAAS compliant authentication and authorization mechanism
to IRMIS desktop. Two login modules are supplied, one which is APS
specific (uses LDAP), and a "do-nothing" login module.

CVS TAG Point: irmisBase_V1.0 (also tagged as irmisBase_20050422-00)

2005 04 21
Added support for using blowfish encrypted hibernate.cfg.xml file in
jar file deployment. Decrypted at runtime. Protects db connection
parameters.

2005 04 18
Introduced an alarm handler and MEDM (adl) crawler, refactoring the
packaging of all the crawlers to use shared utilities. All crawlers
will work with MySQL or Oracle now.

2004 04 15
Added IOC attribute viewer application to IRMIS desktop.

2005 04 07
Added demo application in apps/src/CFWDemo.

2005 04 07
Ported Java pv viewer to new JDesktop support in CFW.

2005 04 05
Added support for encrypting db.properties, and decrypting at runtime in
pv_crawler. blowfish_util.pl added. Protects db connection parameters.

2005 04 04
Fixed build so that templates are re-substituted if site.build.properties is
modified. 

2005 03 24 
Fix to PV Viewer. Added Hibernate Session.clear() prior to every search to clear 
possibly huge numbers of objects from Hibernate session cache.

2005 03 23  
Added Jeff Patton's Oracle fixes for pv_crawler. 
Should run against Oracle at this point.

2005 03 23
Fixed bug in PV Viewer whereby pv history was not displaying correct ioc for given pv.
