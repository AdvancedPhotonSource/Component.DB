Provides java transactional service layer for IRMIS. This is the primary public-facing
API for developing applications based on an IRMIS database. Each method is static and
transactional. This service layer maintains no state from method to method, although the
object graphs produced and used as subsequent arguments to other methods may.
The classes in this package support the IRMIS business-specific sub-packages, such as "pv"
and "component".
The base classes for IRMISService and IRMISException reside here.

The IRMIS service layer is based on an underlying DAO (Data Access Object) persistence layer 
implemented via the open-source ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) tool Hibernate. We are using 
verson 3.1.3 of Hibernate.
