This directory contains a script and cron entry which can be used to
establish a periodic run of the pv_crawler script.

You paste the text in cron.entry into an appropriate crontab, which
then runs the high level run_crawler.sh script. 

All this is not as-of-yet packaged up into a deployment tarball, as
this mechanism is still preliminary.
