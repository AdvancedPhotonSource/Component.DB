IRMIS Schema Creation Scripts
-------------------------------

Claude Saunders (saunders@aps.anl.gov)

This directory contains the .sql scripts for creating the IRMISBase schema.
Since schema creation varies substantially between database vendors, we have
a subdirectory for each database vendor. Feel free to test these for your
database, and let me know of any version incompatibilities, or contribute
scripts for additional databases. 

Note that the mysql directory is the reference directory. The scripts under
mysql are guaranteed to work and are always up-to-date. The scripts under
oracle are not always fully up-to-date and tested, so please compare the
mysql and oracle versions of the scripts before proceeding.

Note that the png (graphical view of schema) files in this directory with
the README are somewhat out-of-date with respect to actual ddl. We need
to update these, but they do capture the essential structure.

The key difference between the mysql scripts and those for Oracle (and
presumably postgres), is that mysql uses auto-increment columns for maintaining
id's, whereas we use sequences for Oracle.

There are also a number of populate scripts which provide core common data,
which individual sites may or may not wish to use. 

There are explicit directions on what order to run the sql scripts in a
README file in each subdirectory (ie. mysql, oracle).

The key sub-schema are currently:
