We don't have enough people to do regular regression testing across
the many possible platforms, java versions, and database engines,
but the following I do know:

You need to use JDK 1.4.2 or later. Works fine on JDK 5 and JDK 6.

The database schema is only current for mysql. We use MySQL 5.x. There
is a partial port of the schema for Oracle, and it was tested a while back.
There have been a few changes to the schema, though, that have not been
kept up-to-date for Oracle. Regardless, the porting is simple, and should
be easy for anyone to compare the mysql and Oracle sql scripts, and bring
the Oracle side up-to-date.

The use of Hibernate means that switching between MySQL and Oracle from the
application perspective is just a configuration property change.
