<p>
Welcome to the IRMIS Desktop; an overall application from
which many smaller interacting IRMIS applications may be run.
All of these application names begin with "idt", which
stands for Irmis DeskTop.
<p>
The available application are:
<ol>
<li>idt::pv - EPICS process variable viewer</li>
<li>idt::ioc - IOC and IOC attribute viewer/editor </li>
<li>idt::component - view/edit system hardware and configuration</li>
<li>idt::component-type - view/edit hardware types</li>
<li>idt::cable - view/edit cables that connect components</li>
<li>idt::admin - administer irmis users and their permissions, plus more...</li>
</ol>
<p>
The individual applications may be chosen from the File->New Document
menu. Also, certain actions within one application will automatically
bring up another. In general, any blue text (link) can
be selected and will enact some action.
<p>
Some application features are not available until you log in using
the Login menu. See the Features section below for a brief explanation of 
the individual applications, and the individual links to the left
for detailed tutorials on each application (coming soon).

<h3>idt::pv - PV Viewer</h3>
<p>
Idt::pv supports finding a specific set of EPICS process variables, or
just browsing all known PVs by various categories. The PVs are organized
by "system", IOC, db file, and record type. Additionally, you may search
using a wildcard pattern for the PV name, and even specify a particular
PV field name and value that must be present.
<p>
The result of a search is a list of process variables. Select one, and
a variety of details about that PV will be shown. The set of all fields
and their values from the db file definition are shown. All links 
(within and across ioc's) that refer to the selected PV are shown. Lastly,
any known references to that PV by external applications is shown. 
<p>
A simple "history mode" is provided, whereby you specify a PV search by
wildcard pattern, and a list of IOC reboots related to that PV is 
displayed. This shows all known IOC boots where this PV was present in
a db file.

<h3>idt::ioc - IOC Viewer/Editor</h3>
<p>
Idt::ioc shows the list of known IOC's. A pink entry means that
ioc is flagged as "inactive" in the database. Selecting an ioc will show
all known attributes for that ioc. If you log in and have been granted
sufficient permissions, you may add new ioc's and edit the
various descriptive attributes.

<h3>idt::component - Component Viewer/Editor</h3>
<p>
Idt::component shows the site hardware organized by three hierarchies. The
most obvious is the housing hierarchy, which shows the physical location of
a component relative to others. The control hierarchy shows what controls
a given component, and what the given component controls (if applicable).
The power hierarchy shows the flow of AC power from the switch gear to the
given component.
<p>
Selecting a component in one hierarchy will show the same component in the
other hierarchies (if applicable). Each hierarchy has a set of buttons and
text boxes above it to assist in locating
a component in the overall facility.
<p>
This application also allows you to create, edit, and delete components if you
have sufficient permissions. Most of these functions begin by selecting a component
and using the right-mouse-click menu to pick what you want to do. Many of the edit
and delete functions first require that you first "send component to configure".
This explicitly places the component you are interested in working with into an
edit mode.
<p>

<h3>idt::component-type - Component Type Viewer/Editor</h3>
Idt::component-type can be used to view details of a particular component type.
For example: show everything we know about the MVME 167 CPU board used in our control
system. This includes a variety of descriptive attributes such as the
responsible engineer, reference documentation, manufacturer, as well as details
such as the physical ports and pins.
<p>
The editing functions are typically only used by IRMIS administrators when new
types of hardware are introduced into the facility.

<h3>idt::cable - Cable Viewer/Editor </h3>
Idt::cable is used to display and edit the physical cabling between ports of
components. You search for components the same was as with idt::component, except
this application also shows the ports for each component. If you click on a port,
the attached cable or cables are shown in a table.
<p>
You can edit existing cables, or add new cables. To add a new cable, you select the
port for one end using the "Component A" section, and then select the port for the
other end using the "Component B" section. Then right-click the "Component B" port
and select "Add Cable" from the pop-up menu. You may then edit the properties of the
cable and then click the "Save" button.
