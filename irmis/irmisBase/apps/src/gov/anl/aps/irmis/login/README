IRMIS Desktop authentication and authorization
   - Claude Saunders

Implemented using a Sun Java JAAS compliant solution. 
There are quite a few files in this directory, so I
hope to explain what is what here.

LoginUtil.java
---------------
This is the entry point for the whole login mechanism.
The login/logout methods do just that. These can be 
directly called from the menu actions of the application.
The login method pops up a dialog (LoginDialog.java)
requesting username and password, after which it 
invokes the JAAS login module that has been configured 
(see the irmis.login property of site.build.properties). 

The registerProtectedComponent method is used to
register Java Swing components along with a set of
roles that are required for that component to be used.
When a user logs in, those components will be enabled.
if the user possesses those roles (more later).

The isPermitted method can be used to programatically
decide whether a block of code should be executed or not.

APSLoginModule.java and DoNothingLoginModule.java
--------------------------------------------------
These are two JAAS LoginModule provided with irmisBase.
The APSLoginModule uses LDAP to authenticate the user,
and the irmis database to retrieve the set of roles
for that user. The DoNothingLoginModule always
authenticates the user, and adds all known roles
(ie. it does no access to external resources).

DummyTrustManager.java and DummySSLSocketFactory.java
-----------------------------------------------------
These files are used by APSLoginModule to circumvent
java's somewhat annoying server certificate check when
accessing LDAP via SSL.

UserPrincipal.java and RolePrincipal.java
-----------------------------------------
These are JAAS concepts which are used to hold
a user's userid and set of allowed roles.

SimpleCallbackHandler.java
--------------------------
A trivial implementation of a userid/password container
required by JAAS.
